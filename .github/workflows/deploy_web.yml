                             # The git root seems to be '/Users/joel/Desktop/git/clover_wallet_app' based on previous context?
                             # Let's check the verify steps. The user has 2 repos or 1 monorepo?
                             # The user info says: 
                             # [URI] -> [CorpusName]: /Users/joel/Desktop/git -> /Users/joel/Desktop/git
                             # But lists '/Users/joel/Desktop/git/clover_wallet_app' as a folder.
                             # If 'clover-wallet' (backend) and 'clover_wallet_app' (frontend) are in the same git repo, I need to adjust paths.
                             # However, earlier 'list_dir' showed '.git' inside 'clover-wallet' and also inside 'clover_wallet_app'.
                             # This suggests they might be separate repositories or submodules. 
                             # If 'clover_wallet_app' has its own .git, then it's a separate repo.
                             # The list_dir output for 'clover_wallet_app' showed a '.git' folder. 
                             # So I will treat it as the root of the repository.
